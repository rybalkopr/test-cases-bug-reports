# Manual Testing Project: Microsoft Copilot

This repository showcases my manual testing skills using Microsoft Copilot as a sample application.

##  Project Description

This project is created to demonstrate my ability to write clear and detailed test cases and bug reports.  
I am familiar with testing tools like **Jira** for bug tracking and **TestRail** for test case management, and I apply best practices in manual testing documentation.

##  Contents

- `test-cases.md` — manual test cases for Microsoft Copilot interface  
- `bug-reports.md` — example bug reports based on UI issues  

##  Tools & Technologies

- Markdown (for documentation)  
- GitHub (for version control and portfolio)  
- Jira (bug tracking)  
- TestRail (test case management)  

##  What was tested?

Focus on Microsoft Copilot interface within Visual Studio Code:

- Login functionality  
- Copilot panel UI  
- Button behaviors ("Generate Code", "Settings")  

##  Sample Bugs

- "Generate Code" button not responding  
- Panel overlap on smaller screens  

##  Purpose

This is a practice and portfolio project to show how I work as a **manual QA engineer**, especially in writing and managing test documentation.

##  About Me

I am learning QA and building my portfolio step by step.
